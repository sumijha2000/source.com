        Time Capsule Creations is a website where you can create virtual time capsules. A time capsule is like a digital treasure chest where you can store memories, messages, photos, or anything else you want to preserve for the future. 
        This website lets you create your own time capsule by uploading content and setting a date for it to be opened in the future. It's a fun way to capture moments and share them with others or keep them for yourself to revisit later."</p>
